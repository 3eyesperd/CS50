0.  According to wikipedia, is ""a factitious word alleged to mean 'a lung disease caused by the inhalation of very fine silica dust, causing inflammation in the lungs.'"
1.  It is a function used to measure performance of processes
2.  16
3.  Because the getrusage takes a pointer as argument, not values. So we must pass memory adresses, not their content.
4.  It loads text into memory, then loads every char into word[], until: i. size limit is reached; ii. it finds a number; iii. the char found isnt a apostrophe or a alphabetical. if [i] or [ii], it scans the file until the end of word ([iii]), and begins the loop again. if [iii] checks for the spelling of the word.
	The loop continues until EOF is founded.
5.  In this architecture, the array that stores the word is limites. Using scanf, we woudlnt have where to put a word bigger than the limit. Since we dont have to know whats de maximum size of the word read by fscanf, our program: [i] would have to be slower (using dynamic size array) [ii] could crash if the words read were very big
6.  Because they dont change during the execution (and const variables are faster to read)
